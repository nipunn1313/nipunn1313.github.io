# About Me

I live in San Francisco. I grew up in the Boston area. My
favorite ice cream place in the region is [Bedford Farms](https://www.bedfordfarmsicecream.com/).
If you disagree, you're entitled to your opinion, and also that opinion is wrong.
I got my BS and MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh (2008 - 2013). I moved to San Francisco in 2013 for work and have enjoyed it
ever since. I've lived in short stints in a few other places (Berkeley 3-mo, Seattle, 3-mo, London 6-mo).
I enjoy
- bowling (I go once a week)
- finding excellent ramen (Mensho in SF, Tsujita in Santa Monica, and Taishoken in San Mateo are some faves in the US)
- Bubble tea - I like tea flavors (Oolong, black tea, hong kong style, and sometimes jasmine).
- Hot Tea
- [SSBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee) - best game ever made. Now with [rollback netcode](https://slippi.gg/)
- Trying out craft beers from local breweries. I have many faves in SF, Oakland, Berkeley, Bend, and Seattle.
- Ultimate Frisbee (recreationally). I used to play competitively in college ([Mr Yuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kZ4Xsb0oew)), and have gotten back into it recreationally.
- chess.com puzzle battle
- Writing code - I actually enjoy it. Especially refactoring.

# Work

Nowadays, I work on open source software. I try to do what calls to me.

I worked for 8 years at Dropbox as a software engineer on just about everything.
I'm proud of my work developing a new [desktop client sync engine](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine),
improving developer environment, continuous integration, and repository structure. I helped extend a team between
SF and Seattle, and kicked off a new team as the technical lead, where I'm especially
proud of how we worked through this whole COVID year transition. Left in April 2021
and have nothing but appreciation for my time there. Met a lot of lifelong friends along the way.

Before that, I interned at Talaria (a small startup building a PHP JIT compiler), Microsoft (on anti-malware),
and MIT Lincoln Labs (working in weather sensing group).
