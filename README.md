# Work

I'm a software engineer at [Convex](https://convex.dev/). We're making a serverless database abstraction that
extends out of the backend directly to frontend react apps. Easy subscription interface. No backend management.
We have to handle a lot of database challenges to make this so seamless for the frontend engineer.
It's been a ton of fun working up and down the stack with a great crew of humans trying to rethink the need for
backend engineers at most companies.
I've been there since Nov, 2021. Shoot me a line if this sounds interesting. We're hiring.

I maintain [mypy-protobuf](https://github.com/dropbox/mypy-protobuf)

I worked for 8 years at Dropbox (2013-2021) as a software engineer on just about everything.
I'm proud of my work developing a new [desktop client sync engine](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine),
improving developer environment, continuous integration, and repository structure. I helped extend a team between
SF and Seattle, and kicked off a new team as the technical lead, where I'm especially
proud of how we worked through the COVID year transition. Left in April 2021
and have nothing but appreciation for my time there. Met a lot of lifelong friends along the way.
I like to think I've become a great engineer, leader, and the kind of friend/human others want on their team, acknowledging
of course that all three of those things are lifelong journeys. Before that, I interned at Talaria (startup making a PHP JIT compiler that sold to Google), Microsoft (on anti-malware), and MIT Lincoln Labs (working in weather sensing group).

# About Me

I live in San Francisco. I grew up in the Boston area. 
I got my BS and MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh (2008 - 2013). I moved to San Francisco in 2013 for work and have enjoyed it
ever since. I've lived in short stints in a few other places (Berkeley 3-mo, Seattle, 3-mo, London 6-mo).
I enjoy
- Spending time with my pupper Pepper
- bowling (I go once a week. Trying to raise my average)
- finding excellent ramen (Mensho in SF, Tsujita in Santa Monica, and Taishoken in San Mateo are some faves in the US)
- Tea - hot tea and bubble tea. I like tea flavors (Oolong, black tea, hong kong style, and sometimes jasmine). Make it myself at home.
- [SSBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee) - best game ever made. Now with [rollback netcode](https://slippi.gg/)
- Trying out craft beers from local breweries. I have many faves in SF, Oakland, Berkeley, Bend, Seattle, and beyond.
- Ultimate Frisbee (recreationally). I used to play competitively in college ([Mr Yuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kZ4Xsb0oew)), and have gotten back into it recreationally.
- chess.com puzzle battle
- Ice Cream. My favorite ice cream place is [Bedford Farms](https://www.bedfordfarmsicecream.com/).
If you disagree, you're entitled to your opinion, and also that opinion is wrong.
- Reading and writing code - I really enjoy it. Especially refactoring.
- Stacking diffs. The fact that https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4477 is not solved on github is a travesty.
